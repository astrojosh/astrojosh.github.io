## Projects

A showcase of some of the open source projects I have developed:

### Collision Simulator

A simple physics simulator to model collisions between a moving ball and a large mass stationary object. Written in Python and includes options to change stationary object, provides information on the number of bounces that occur and comparison with approximate formulae derived quantitatively.
